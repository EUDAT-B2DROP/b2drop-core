        <h2>1. How to get an account?</h2>
        <p>B2DROP uses B2ACCESS as identity provider. If the user already has a B2ACCESS account, click on the

        <h3>1.1 How to reset the password?</h3>

        <h2>2. How can I use a sync/calendar or address book client?</h2>
        <p>Because most clients do not support the external authentication, the user must create an app password. This
            credentials must be used within the client. The credentials are only shown once, during the creation. The
            app password can be created in the users <a href="/index.php/settings/user/security">security

        <p>B2DROP is provided via EUDAT which is co-funded by the European Commission. EUDAT – European Data
            Infrastructure – is an initiative which is building a sustainable pan-European infrastructure for research
            data. It brings together a consortium of 25 partners, including national data and high performance computing
            (HPC) centres, technology providers, research communities, and research councils from 13 countries. EUDAT
            provides generic data services, such as storage and computing services to European researchers and research
            communities, and offer a joint metadata service integrating metadata from different communities into easily
            searchable and open catalogues. In the unlikely event that the B2DROP service would draw to a close in the
            future, we guarantee to keep your accessible for at least 6 months.</p>
